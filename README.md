# customer-data-optimization-for-predictive-modeling
This project addresses the challenge of slow model training caused by large datasets. Working for "Training Data Ltd," the analysis builds a data processing pipeline that reduces memory usage by converting standard data types into efficient formats (e.g., booleans, categories, int32, float16) and filters the dataset for high-value candidates.
